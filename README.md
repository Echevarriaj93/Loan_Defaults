# Loan_Defaults
Setting out to predict Loan Defaults using Machine Learning models such as XGboost and Neural Networks.


Research Question and Data:

How can we effectively assess and mitigate the risk of loan default in our lending portfolio by leveraging borrower characteristics and loan attributes?


The dataset I will be using to answer the research question was acquired from Kaggleâ€™s Loan Default Prediction Competition.


Introduction:

This study aims to investigate whether individuals who appear similar are more likely to default on a loan compared to others. By analyzing various factors and characteristics, the goal is to identify predictors that can differentiate between borrowers who are more likely to default and those who are not. By leveraging these predictors we want to be able to detect borrower applications that will default. 

Lending is always accompanied by risk and it is important to mitigate this risk. Machine Learning is still a relatively new field that can prove useful in detecting patterns in lending data that humans can not. By understanding the factors that contribute to loan defaults, banks and financial institutions can develop more accurate and effective models for assessing creditworthiness. This, in turn, helps lenders make informed decisions, minimize default rates, and manage their lending portfolios more effectively.

Previous studies have explored the prediction of loan defaults using various modeling techniques. Commonly used models include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. With such a wide spread of options it is safe to say  that the most optimal model for a given project will depend on the data available and the preprocessing approach used. For example, a paper conducted at the university of Beijing in 2022 by Herui Chen found that the best models for that study were a logistic regression and a Neural Network. Another study by Wanjun Wu from ByteDance in the same year concluded that the best models for their Loan Default prediction were Random Forest and XGBoost. Typically, these models leverage different combinations of features, such as credit history, income, debt-to-income ratio, employment status, and other relevant variables, to predict loan defaults. These studies have provided insights into the factors associated with default risk and have laid the foundation for further research in this area. Like previous studies I will have to dive deep into the features available in my dataset to perform analysis, to feature engineer and select the best performing model, therefore identifying the most important features for predicting loan defaults.

In order to paint a clear picture of my study, this paper will follow a well outlined process to ensure a professional Loan Default prediction project is delivered. This introduction serves as the first deliverable in the overall process. Here I have described the topic, its importance and discussed previous studies. The next phase is the literature review which is the foundational piece for my research. More will be discussed surrounding previous studies on the Loan Default prediction topic in hopes of gaining useful insights for my research and data set. Furthermore this will serve as a deep dive into the features that will be used (or not) for this research. After Literature Review, will be the modeling phase in which insights gathered from the data will be highlighted after analysis and key features will be discussed as potentially important predictors of loan defaults. Finally, I will wrap things up with a conclusion providing a summary of my findings, best performing models for this study, important features and potential routes for future research. Through the framework that is used for this project I will be able to share the steps I take to come to the conclusions of my study in a sound comprehendable format.
